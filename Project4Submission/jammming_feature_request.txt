                            OBJECTIVE
If a user refreshes the access token, permit the existing playlist information, if any, 
to survive the refresh.


                            BACKGROUND 
Our users have expressed that they don't like having to re-enter playlist search 
info if forced to refresh the screen.

                          TECHNICAL DESIGN
A. Spotify.js
   
   1. At the end of the existing savePlaylist method, add 
      commands to save the existing track TERM value.  My
      recommendation is to use 'sessionStorage' variables,
      as once set, they remain static until changed or until
      the end of this browser session.  The command could 
      look like:
      sessionStorage.setItem('srchTerm', searchTerm);

      Put it just after the third 'fetch'.

B. App.js
   1. method 'search':
      a. If the sessionStorage.setItem('srchTerm') exists, then
         save it to a srchIn variable.
      b. Add an 'if' statement.  If srchIn exists, and has a
         non-zero length, then return it in 
         'this.Spotify.search(srchIn)';  if not, then return
         the existing 'this.Spotify.search(term)'.
